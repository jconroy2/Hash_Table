# Hash_Table
This program implements a hash table with separate chaining to manage integer values efficiently. The hash table uses a direct hash function  ℎ ( 𝑥 ) = 𝑥 h(x)=x to compute the hash code for each value. Collisions are resolved using linked lists, ensuring that multiple values hashing to the same index are stored without overwriting.
